# CMPUT 503: Experimental Mobile Robotics

In this repo, we share the implementation of the labs and the final project for the duckiebot platform. The labs are as follows: 
1. Lab 1: Assemble the bot and write a simple color detector
2. Lab 3: Localize the robot using landmarks in the environment and by doing inverse kinematics
3. Lab 4: Do lane following, or follow robots
4. Lab 5: Detect and classify digits in the wild
5. Final project: Do a sequence of tasks that involve lane following, turning, stopping at intersections and stop signs, stopping and going around obstacles, and parking.
